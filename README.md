# ArcAngel- tamuHACK ESRI sponser challange winner 

We were inspired to create this mobile and web application after the recent effects of Hurrican Harvey. During the event, many were in need of medical attention and relocation services. When people tried to call 9-1-1 they would be left with unanswered calls because the lines were backed up. One of the main things we noticed during this time was that people began to resort to twitter to post their current situation along with their location and that they were in need of help. Becuase people were able to retweet their tweets,  volunteers and EMT were able to assist these families in need.
